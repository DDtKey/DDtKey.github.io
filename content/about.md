Hi, Iâ€™m Artem Medvedev ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer who loves building reliable, high-performance distributed systems.
I enjoy taking full ownership of what I build â€” from designing architecture and writing code to running services in production.

Iâ€™m always learning, aiming for technical excellence, and building things that make a real difference ðŸš€
